## Start the c3os ISO

Download and mount the ISO in either baremetal or a VM that you wish to use as a node for your cluster.

It doesn't matter if you are joining a node to an existing cluster or creating a new one, the procedure is still the same.

A GRUB menu will be displayed:

Select the third entry (`c3os (interactive install)`).

A boot splash screen will appear, and right after a prompt, asking for installation settings:

After entering all the details, the installation will start, returning finally at the shell.
